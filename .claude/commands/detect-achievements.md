# Detect Achievements

Scan recent git commits and automatically create ACHIEVEMENT memories for significant work.

## Options

- `--since` N: Look back N hours (default: 24)
- `--dry-run`: Show what would be saved without saving
- `--platform`: Track which spaceship detected this
- `--help`, `-h`: Show help

## Examples

```
/detect-achievements                           # Scan last 24 hours
/detect-achievements --since 48                # Scan last 48 hours
/detect-achievements --dry-run                 # Preview without saving
/detect-achievements --platform claude         # Tag achievements with platform
```

## How It Works

Scans commit messages for patterns indicating achievements:
- Feature completion ("add", "implement", "complete")
- Version releases (v1.0.0, milestone, release)
- Major fixes ("fix critical", "resolve")
- Refactoring and migrations
- Test milestones (100% coverage, tests passing)

Skips non-achievements: WIP, fixup, merge, revert, chore commits.
