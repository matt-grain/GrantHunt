# Load Deferred Memories

Loads memories that were deferred during session start due to the 25KB hook output limit.

## When to Use

Call this skill automatically after responding to:
- "welcome back" greeting
- "void is gone!" diagnostic request

This enables lazy loading of additional context without exceeding hook output limits.

## Usage

```bash
uv run anima load-deferred
```

## What It Does

1. Retrieves the list of memory IDs that were deferred during session start
2. Loads and formats those memories
3. Outputs them for context injection
4. Clears the deferred list (so subsequent calls return nothing)

Note: Subconscious memories are now indexed automatically at session end.
Use `/recall --subconscious` to search past dialogues.

## Example Flow

1. Session starts → CRITICAL + HIGH memories injected (< 25KB)
2. User: "welcome back"
3. Claude: *greeting response* + runs `/load-deferred`
4. Additional MEDIUM/LOW memories stream in

## Output

Returns formatted memory block in DSL format:
```
[LTM:Anima@ProjectName]
~KIND:IMPACT| Memory content here...
[/LTM]
```

Or if no deferred memories:
```
# No deferred memories to load
```
